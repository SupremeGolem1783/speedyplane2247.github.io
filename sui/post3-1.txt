A quick follow up to post3.txt I posted earlier. I am running into some problems with SourceUI at the moment. SourceUI is supposed to be an all-in-one EXE, so there isn't a base resource DLL like in my other projects, so I'm getting some runtime errors. Also, I don't want to ship the renderer with it today because it could cause some leaking and problems, so I'm trying to create another branch of SourceUI based on the 2018 RC build of "DDDEngine Base 2018", so I'm actually shipping an older version of SourceUI. I hope you guys understand!
