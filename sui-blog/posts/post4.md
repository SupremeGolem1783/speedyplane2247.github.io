Hey guys! Wanted to give a little update on Source UI! I have finally gotten the renderor working with the new update!
## Content

## Render
The renderer windows shows now, but thats about it, From the log:
``` 
SourceUI Initilized.
Render LOG STARTED:
sui_versionupdatefromDLL: true
214,319x : {sui_render_error_invalidmap}
We're done here. It seems your worst nightmare has trued.
```
The log shows that it was trying to render the DirectX crash map, but failing over and over again. (200,000 times it seems.) 
## Solitare
This update changes SourceUI to Solitare's Render Engine.
## Media
I have recorded another little video demoing it, and playing a bit solitare. https://youtu.be/IyqVWmi_3Eg
