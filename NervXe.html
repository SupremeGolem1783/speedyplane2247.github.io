<h2><span style="color:#FFD700;"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;"><span style="background-color:#00FF00;">You come and see something you don&#39;t like.</span></span></span></h2>

<h3><span style="color:#FFD700;"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;"><span style="background-color:#00FF00;">This is kind of sad. Your files might be gone, but your heart isn&#39;t!&nbsp;</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span style="color:#FFD700;"><span style="font-family:comic sans ms,cursive;"><span style="background-color:#00FF00;">Sadly, you have been detected as spreading malware from your computer via Trollbox! Because of this, we sent a picture that happens to contain subliminal messaging, to click on the /exe. I&#39;m not hacking!!!</span></span></span></p>

<p>restarting is the worst thing you could possibly do in this situation. an archive of all your files is stored somewhere, but I won&#39;t say. want to see? this button will destroy your files!<button onclick="location.href = 'https://google.com'">bye</button>&nbsp; anyways, thanks for spreading malware!</p>
